Simple sequence words. Search two sets of words such that some number of last characters for any word of first set are  first characters of any word from second set. Consider two sets. The first one consists of two words <i>animated</i> and <i>exanimated</i>. The second one also has two words <i>animated</i> and <i>animatedly</i>. Last eight letters of any word <i>animated</i> or <i>exanimated</i>, agree with first eight letters of words <i>animated</i> and <i>animatedly</i>.<br><i>Note.</i> Word <i>animated</i> has eight characters and first eight characters are the same with last eight characters. So any word is a sequence of itself. If there are no words found which starts from <i>animated</i> or ended by <i>animated</i> then set is not consider as trivial.

For more information you can make internet search with request string <i>regular expressions of perl</i>.
Double sequence words. Search two sets of words such that some number of last characters for any word of first set are  first characters of any word from second set and vice versa. Consider two sets. The first one consists of two words <i>bleeder</i> and <i>blender</i>. The second one also has two words <i>derisible</i> and <i>derivable</i>. Last three letters of any word <i>bleeder</i> or <i>blender</i>, agree with first three letters of words <i>derisible</i> and <i>derivable</i>. And at the same time last three characters of <i>derisible</i> and <i>derisible</i> are first characters of any word <i>bleeder</i> or <i>blender</i>.<br><i>Note.</i> As in the case of searching for sequence words trivial sets are excluded.

Syntax <i>+index,string</i>.<br>String <i>+0,b</i> add character <i>b</i> to the beginning (before first symbol of word). String <i>+2,we</i> inserts <i>we</i> before third symbol of word. String <i>+L,y</i> add <i>y</i> to the end. String <i>+L-1,s</i> inserts <i>s</i> before last symbol of word.<br>SUBSTRINGS. Syntax <i>-index,length</i>.<br>String <i>-0,3</i> leaves first three chars of word. String  <i>-4,3</i> leaves three chars from fifth char. If second parameter is not set (eg. <i>-3</i>), then left all chars till the end (from fourth symbol). String <i>-L-5,3</i> leaves three letters from fifth char from the end of the word. String <i>-L-5</i> leaves last five chars. Other string examples <i>-4,L-5</i> <i>-L-4,L-5</i>.<br>Not all of replaces change word.
